C                   Gm
She promised you stars
                       F
Like you read all her pages
               D
All of the tension
                   C  
And the company of strangers
                     Gm
The fear that you came with
                     F
You though you'd escaped it
                  Am
But even while breaking
     G               F
You could still be persuaded
         D
Looking out...
           G
Across the lights...
             D
Until the morning
     Am
Oh, but didn't they shine
   G        F
Like a night sky
            Am
Didn't they shine
   G          F
Like a hazy day rain
      D               G           E
Like champagne and heartbreak
                 Am
But didn't they shine
(Oh, didn't they shine)
   G            F
Like a night sky
(yeah, yeah, yeah)
                Am
But didn't they shine
(Oh, didn't they shine)
